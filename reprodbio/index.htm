In flowering plants, this exchange happens when a pollen tube (the male component) contacts an ovule (the female component). One difference from the familiar animal model is that pollen and ovule may both come from the same individual, in a process called self-fertilization. Self-fertilization is advantageous in that it removes the need to mate with another plant of the same species. However, it can lead to negative genetic consequences such as often arise in inbreeding animal populations.</p><p><img src="./Nphd-self-outcross.gif"></p><p style="font-size:14px;margin:0px 0px 10px"><b>Avoiding Self-Fertilization</b></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even plants that are <i>able</i> to self-fertilize may receive greater benefit from mating with a different plant (i.e., outcrossing). Many plants have physical or genetic mechanisms to minimize self-fertilization and promote outcrossing, and these are discussed in more detail on the <a href="../reprodsys/index.htm">Reproductive System Evolution</a> page. In <i>Nymphoides</i>, a genus of floating-leaved aquatic plants, reproductive systems include unisexual flowers (in dioecious species) and two kinds of hermaphroditic flowers: heterostylous and homostylous. Although some plants are hermaphroditic and genetically self-compatible (i.e., they produce seeds readily through self-fertilization), the other reproductive systems all promote outcrossing to some extent.</p><p style="font-size:14px;margin:0px 0px 10px"><b>Reproducing Asexually</b></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the myriad array of sexual reproductive conditions found in plants, many are capable of asexual reproduction (also known as clonal or vegetative reproduction). They can accomplish this by methods that are simple or complex, but the end result remains the same. The result of asexual reproduction is a descendent plant that is genetically identical to its parent. This differs from all types of sexual reproduction, even self-fertilization, because these allow for recombination of genetic material. In <i>Nymphoides</i>, asexual reproduction happens most often through the production of roots from some part of the plant stem, and these roots can go on to establish a new plant.</p><table border=0 cellspacing=10 width=780><tr><td width=400><img src="./Naqu-roots_DSCN4235.jpg"><td width=180 valign=top><b>Roots emerging from the stem of <i>Nymphoides aquatica</i> near a floating leaf, at the same node from which a flower cluster emerged previously. These roots can establish a descendent plant and thus enable vegetative reproduction.</b><td>&nbsp;</table><p style="font-size:14px;margin:0px 0px 10px"><b>The Tradeoff: Sexual or Asexual Reproduction?</b></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the many options available to plants for reproduction, there is a broad array of ways in which they can be combined. Plants can rely variously on sexual or asexual reproduction, and their sexual reproduction can range anywhere from forced self-fertilization to forced outcrossing. The end result in every case is that offspring are produced, but the reproduction methods differ in how they recombine genetic information, either not at all (in asexual reproduction), between closely related individuals (in self-fertilization or inbreeding), or between distantly related individuals.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the genus <i>Nymphoides</i>, I study the interaction among these reproduction modes. Some of the more interesting questions to address in this group are: how much do the plants rely on sexual or asexual reproduction, and what are the consequences of prolonged asexual reproduction? Some <i>Nymphoides</i> species do very well at reproducing asexually, and researchers have found strong mechanisms in these species to promote outcrossing. The genetic result of this is that asexual reproduces genetically identical offpring, sometimes very many of them, but the genetic self-incompatibility associated with heterostyly forces most or all instances of sexual reproduction to be between less related individuals. I continue to research the tradeoffs between asexual and sexual reproduction, and to explore their implications in fields such as conservation and invasive species management.</p><p style="font-size:14px;margin:0px 0px 10px"><b><i>Nymphoides peltata</i>: a Case Study for Invasive Species Management</b></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Nymphoides peltata</i> (yellow flowting-heart or water fringe) is a species native to Eurasia that has become established in many of the United States, where its populations range in size from inconspicuous patches to obviously problematic swaths. <i>Nymphoides peltata</i> reproduces asexually by rooting along the length of its flowering stem, and it can grow rapidly to cover much of the water surface. Sexual reprodution happens between hermaphroditic flowers, and self-fertilization is prevented by a genetic self-incompatibility system associated with heterostyly.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because <i>N. peltata</i> is an exotic and potentially invasive species in the United States, it is important to learn how it reproduces and spreads. Are the plants reproducing only asexually? only sexually? or some combination of these? and what are the genetic consequences? I continue to pursue these questions and others in my research.</p><table border=0 cellspacing=10 width=780><tr><td width=600><img src="./Npel-SpoWA-DSCN3503.jpg"><td valign=top><b>A population of <i>Nymphoides peltata</i> in Lake Spokane, Washington.
