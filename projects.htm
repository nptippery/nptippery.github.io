<b>Research Opportunities</b></p>

<p>
Research in the Tippery Lab depends upon the participation of enthusiastic student researchers! Students are welcome to try out research on a volunteer basis, with no time commitment or other requirements. More advanced and experienced students are encouraged to enroll for Independent Study credit, either Biology 498 (exploratory research, no presentation required) or Biology 498R (directed project, presentation required at end of semester). Independent Study credits require a time commitment of three hours per week per enrolled credit.

<p>
Feel free to browse the project descriptions below, and if one of them draws your attention you can <a href=mailto:tipperyn@uww.edu>contact Dr. Tippery</a> to discuss the possibility of working on it.

<b>Phylogeny of <i>Nymphoides</i></b></p>

<p>
<i>Nymphoides</i> is a genus of flowering plants that have floating leaves supporting their rather tiny flowers. Although they look similar to water lilies (genus <i>Nymphaea</i>), <i>Nymphoides</i> are actually more closely related to plants in the sunflower family (Asteraceae).

<p>
The current picture of phylogenetic (i.e., evolutionary) relationships in <i>Nymphoides</i> is complicated by the fact that data from different genes fail to agree on a congruent tree (see below). In previous work, I gathered data from the chloroplast (inherited from the maternal parent) and the nucleus (inherited from both parents), and the disagreement between these data could indicate past or ongoing hybridization among species.

<p>
The strategy for moving forward will be to sequence more genes, including some from the nucleus that may exist in multiple copies as a result of genomic doubling (i.e., polyploidization). The tools available include some genomic DNA sequence data that another lab generated for <i>Nymphoides</i> and related genera.

<p>
<u>Project specifics:</u>
<ul style="line-height:200%">
<li>
Perform DNA extraction, PCR, and sequencing on select <i>Nymphoides</i> species
<li>
Align DNA sequences from different species and conduct phylogenetic analysis to construct a tree of relationships
<li>
Compare new data to existing data to determine if disagreement among genes can be explained
</ul>

<td width=360 valign=top><b>Phylogeny of <i>Nymphoides</i>.</b> Data from the two genes sequenced thus far disagree considerably about the relationships within the genus. The left tree resulted from analysis of a gene from the nucleus (ITS), whereas the right tree represents a chloroplast gene (<i>matK/trnK</i>). Disagreement between the trees is indicated by lines across the middle of the figure (from <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1600/036364411X605092" target="_blank">Tippery and Les, 2011</a>).

<b>Evolution of inflorescence architecture</b></p>

<p>
<i>Nymphoides</i> species have a close association between their flowers that open above water and the floating leaves that support them. The close relatives of <i>Nymphoides</i> do not have floating leaves, and their flowers are supported on tall inflorescences. Understanding the mechanism by which the <i>Nymphoides</i> inflorescence evolved will help to explain how these and other aquatic plants adapted to their life in the water.

<p>
Interestingly, there are three different strategies that <i>Nymphoides</i> species have employed to support their flowers. Two of these are mapped on the tree above, with black lines indicating species with an expanded inflorescence and white lines indicating a condensed inflorescence.

<p>
The diagram below represents the three different <i>Nymphoides</i> inflorescence strategies. In that study, I determined that the different inflorescence forms have only minor differences among them, such as the lengths of internodes and the sizes of leaves.

<p>
Work remains to be done to explore an instance of convergent evolution, whereby the condensed inflorescence evolved at least twice. In addition, preliminary evidence indicates that inflorescences can vary among individuals within a species, and this needs to be examined with more data.

<p>
<u>Project specifics:</u>
<ul style="line-height:200%">
<li>
Dissect preserved inflorescences and document their morphologies
<li>
Prepare specimens for thin sectioning using a microtome, and examine them under the microscope
<li>
Reconstruct the inflorescences of these species and draw conclusions about variation and evolutionary history
</ul>

<table border=0 cellspacing=10 width=780>
<tr><td width=350 valign=top><b><i>Nymphoides</i> inflorescence architectures.</b> Different species have different strategies for supporting their flowers with floating leaves. Some inflorescences are expanded (A), with long internodes, whereas others are condensed (B and C), having many flowers arising from the same location. This diagram shows overall forms, but interestingly the diagrams all are based on the same general plan.

<b>Population biology of an invasive species</b></p>

<p>
<i>Nymphoides peltata</i> is native to Eurasia, but over the last century populations have become established across North America. Some populations are aggressive and interfere with native plants, whereas others appear not to pose a threat and may even die out over time. Interestingly, people undertake measures to conserve <i>N. peltata</i> in its native range, so it would be doubly useful to understand how to control the species in North America and conserve it in Eurasia.

<p>
Studies have examined the reproductive biology of <i>N. peltata</i> in Europe and eastern Asia. However, it appears to have a different biology in North America. For example, the species exhibits genetic self-incompatibility, which should prevent certain populations from producing seeds. Nonetheless, North American populations produce seeds abundantly. Work needs to be done to determine how the plants are pollinated, to what extent their self-incompatibility operates, and their likelihood of establishing new populations from seeds.

<p>
<u>Project specifics (one or more of these could become a whole project):</u>
<ul style="line-height:200%">
<li>
Conduct pollination experiments on captive populations of <i>N. peltata</i>, and determine factors that affect the number of seeds produced
<li>
Grow seeds from wild and captive plants to explore requirements for germination
<li>
Grow seedlings in various nutrient combinations to determine their ideal growth conditions
<li>
Using genetic tools, examine genetic relationships among individuals and populations
