During the evolutionary history of a plant lineage, the various advantages and disadvantages of self-fertilizing, outcrossing, and reproducing asexually have influenced the phylogenetic distribution of reproductive systems in related species. One of the most interesting biological questions that can be addressed using plants is the evolution of dioecy, i.e., the separation of genders into male and female plants. Flowering plants were ancestrally hermaphroditic, producing male and female organs within the same flower. Nonetheless, evolutionary processes have promoted the evolution of dioecy in many different plant groups. This allows us to research the factors that cause species to evolve separate sexes and to look for general 'rules' that might apply across all dioecious species. Moreover, it allows us to determine factors that promote dioecy and the intermediate stages that may be involved during the transition from a hermaphroditic ancestor to a dioecious species.</p><p style="font-size:14px;margin:0px 0px 10px"><b>Heterostyly</b></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dioecy is one of many mechanisms that plants use to promote outcrossing (i.e., the exchange of genetic material between different plants instead of within the same plant). One of the most complex mechanisms, and one that surprisingly has evolved in many different plant lineages, combines physical and genetic mechanisms into one system. This system, known as heterostyly, most noticeably involves the production of two (or three) kinds of flowers by plants of the same species. Each plant produces only one kind of flower, and these differ in the lengths of the style (part of the female reproductive structure) and filaments (part of the male reproductive structure). Male and female parts are produced on the same flower, so the first obvious advantage to heterostyly is that it positions the anthers, which contain pollen, at a different height than the stigma, which receives pollen. This helps to prevent pollen from contacting a stigma within the same flower. The two types of flowers in heterostylous species differ in whether the anthers are higher than the stigma or vice versa, and flowers of one type have organs at a position compatible with the organs of the other flower type. Which is to say that anthers of a short-styled flower are at the same position as stigmas of long-styled flowers. Therefore, in addition to preventing self-pollination by separating anthers from stigmas, the flowers of heterostylous species encourage outcrossing by facilitating pollination between two plants with different flower types.</p><table border=0 cellspacing=10 width=780><tr><td><img src="./heterostyly2.gif"></p><td valign=top><b>Heterostylous flowers are either short-styled with long stamens (left) or long-styled with short stamens (right). Pollination within a flower is prevented by the physical separation of organs and also by a genetic self-incompatibility mechanism. Pollination between flowers of the same flower type are also prevented genetically. Heterostyly thus encourages pollination between flowers of different types.</b></table><p style="font-size:14px;margin:0px 0px 10px"><b>Dioecy</b></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming from an animal perspective, dioecy may seem like a superior mode of reproduction. But for plants, many of which are hermaphroditic, the transition to dioecy involves a costly compromise. Flowers that produce only male or only female reproductive organs are disadvantaged relative to hermaphroditic flowers that have both organ types, because they can mate with only about half of the population at any one time. In order to counter this disadvantage, dioecious species must be extra proficient at specializing male and female functions, or the negative effects of inbreeding must be substantial enough to justify lost mating opportunities.</p><table border=0 cellspacing=10 width=780><tr><td width=211><img src="./Naqu-pistillate_DSCN7828.jpg" width=211><td width=219><img src="./Naqu-staminate_DSCN7547	.jpg" width=219><td valign=top><b>Pistillate (i.e., female) and staminate (i.e., male) flowers of <i>Nymphoides aquatica</i>. The pistillate flower (left) has a functional stigma (the feathery structure atop the green pistil at flower center) but its anthers are pale and non-functional. In contrast, the staminate flower (right) has anthers that are yellow with functional pollen, but the stigma is absent from the pistil, rendering this organ non-functional. Note that both flower types have yellow glands between their anthers that should not be confused with the actual anthers.</b></table><p style="font-size:14px;margin:0px 0px 10px"><b>Reproductive System Evolution in <i>Nymphoides</i></b></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Nymphoides</i> presents an exciting opportunity to study the evolution of reproductive systems such as heterostyly and dioecy, because both systems as well as homostyly are present in the genus. Using phylogenetic research methods, I work to reconstruct the relationships among <i>Nymphoides</i> species, which can inform the order of transitions among reproductive systems and infer the most recent ancestor of dioecious species. Data obtained so far have revealed several independent losses of heterostyly (toward homostyly) and a probable reacquisition of heterostyly from a homostylous ancestor. Results thus far are inconclusive about the direct ancestor of dioecious species, although the data favor the reconstuction of a homostylous ancestor. Continuing research will sample additional <i>Nymphoides</i> species and sequence additional gene regions in order to develop a more complete understanding of reproductive system evolution in <i>Nymphoides</i>.</p></table></table></body></html>
